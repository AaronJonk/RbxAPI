# RbxAPI
A easy-to-use Roblox api

You will need a API key for this to work!
Get it right here: https://discord.gg/nYckGq7

 - 10$ for a month
 - 25$ for 3 months
 - 50$ for lifetime key

Keys may not get shared! We do IP log. If your key gets used from multiple IP's at the same time, we will blacklist your key.

In class.php is there a small config!
```
// Config
public $key = ""; // API key, get it from https://discord.gg/nYckGq7
public $base = "https://api.rbxvault.store?"; // Do not change this
```
